I chose this meme because having one week between semesters is not enough time.

[Example 1](https://github.com/nktnlx/data_analysis_portfolio#video-games-sales-analysis)

[Example 2](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio)

I like these two different types of resumes because it looks like something I could do right now. 

The first example shows each project with the code and some slide. There is a descrpition and then the
skills and technolgy used for each. It feels like this is set up in the exact way that my brain works. 
I can also tell that theres is a few passion projects on this instead of just having projects that I saw
on all of the different portfolios that I found.

The second example breaks it down in parts of data science like machine learning and then breaks it down
in the languages used for each project. I don't mesh with it the same way the first example does but it
is something to consider.


[Example 3](http://julianikulski.com/en/portfolio?lang=en)

This one takes a lot of things that I liked from the first example, but it lookes more professional. It could
be something I aspire to. Also I want ot point out that the project that pulled me in was the Falling in Love
with AI showing that I want to showcase some passion projects.

[Example 4](https://vallabhamohta.wixsite.com/portfolio/skills)

This is has some fun ideas and things that I could add to mine to make it a little more unique. I specifically like
the idea of the bar chart,a nd kind of make it my own.
